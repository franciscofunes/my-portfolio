# PORTFOLIO-APP 

Hello everyone through the following tutorial i have developed my portfolio using the React.js framework '[How to create your portfolio website using React.js](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/portfolio-app-using-react-618814e35843)'
- To run this project follow these steps , 
  - clone the repo using `git clone`
  - navigate to folder `portfolio-app`
  - run `npm install` to instal node modules
  - run `npm start` to start the service on `localhost:3000`

My intention is to continue developing and researching on this powerful framework.
